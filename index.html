      <p>For me, my passion in life are cats. When you’re photographing cats, remember to treat them as friends, and your photos will be full of emotions. Be patient and respect your subject — never force a cat to do something against his or her will.</p>

      <h3 id="paragraph-3">Párrafo 3</h3>

      <p>Below are some of my cat photography tips:
      1. Carry your camera with you all the time. It’s the only way to be in the right place at the right time. You don’t want to miss all the unexpected situations that cats put themselves into. You never know when you may come across a unique and beautiful cat doing something really funny or cool.</p>

      <h3 id="paragraph-4">Párrafo 4</h3>

      <p>For shooting action photos of running or jumping cats, it’s not a shame to put the device on automatic mode. No matter how fast you are with the settings, the cat is always one step ahead of you — you may miss the perfect frame or moment.
